  "TITLE": "Episode 79 - The Deleted Dr. Campbell",
  "NUMBER": 79,
  "DESCRIPTION": "Maddie and Jessie bring on @drbradleycampbell , the day of his Big Deletion from IG, and we talk about the censorship those dissenting voices from the medical community have faced and still face on a daily basis. We also talk about his hands-on experience treating patients all year, with the Coof, post the jabs, and what all that looks like in reality. Team Doom won’t like this one, but we had a great time having a truth-seeking conversation with someone trying to make a difference and give a voice to others.",
