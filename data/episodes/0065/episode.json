  "TITLE": "Episode 65 - Thankful for Decency",
  "NUMBER": 65,
  "DESCRIPTION": "This week, Jessie and I are back to rehash the electoral weirdness and break down both parties’ reactions. We highlight how the corporate media and social networks are trying to control the narrative and how desperate they are. We are thankful for the eye-opening opportunities these clowns in high towers are giving us, which is almost as good a gift as being able to spend the holidays with family, cherishing the things and the people we hold dear. What are you thankful for in our current dystopia?",
