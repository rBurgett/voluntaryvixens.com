  "NUMBER": 22,
  "DESCRIPTION": "Jessie and Maddie made it back together -- feelings of cancellation and other stress-related excuses just couldn't keep us apart! In light of #stressawarenessday, we accepted that as a sign that maybe we should talk about stress, anxiety, depression, how to manage our own stress and strife, and take care of ourselves so that we can deal with the other tragedies of life that are outside of our control. We share tips and strategies that we use and that are accessible to everyone - making you saner libertarian in (okay we went over...) 30 minutes a day!",
