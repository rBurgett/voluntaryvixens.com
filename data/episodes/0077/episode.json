  "NUMBER": 77,
  "DESCRIPTION": "Jessie and Maddie are joined by Mr. Factz himself, of the Moe Factz w/ Adam Curry podcast. They discuss the importance of paying attention to, but avoiding falling victim to the divisive propaganda splitting the genders apart further, how to bridge the gaps and animosity at play between men and women today, and the benefits of playing to your own genders' strengths in terms of growing healthy families and communities. I guess this might be triggering to some? I guess biology is sexist? We'll let you decide.",
