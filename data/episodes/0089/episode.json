  "TITLE": "Episode 89 - Speaking Truth to Medical Power with Dr. Lindsay",
  "NUMBER": 89,
  "DESCRIPTION": "The Vixens this week are joined by friend, colleague, and ally, Dr. Janci Lindsay, PhD. She’s a molecular biologist, pulmonary toxicologist, and made her “internet break” when she gave a public comment to the CDC about her numerous concerns about the ongoing jab rollouts we’re all witnessing. Considering the attempted censorship, canceling, and discrediting of any “dissenters”, it’s nice to have an expert on our side, speaking truth to the medical powers that be.”",
