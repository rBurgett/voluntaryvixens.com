  "NUMBER": 6,
  "DESCRIPTION": "Jessie and Maddie come to you on Memorial Day Weekend to discuss the tragedy and after effects of War. We honor the troops by calling out the warmongers that got us into past foreign interventions and rail against those that only seek to do more. Why not give peace a chance after all this time and all of these lives lost? We're not experts in history or foreign policy, but follow good people that are, and would suggest anyone do the same.",
