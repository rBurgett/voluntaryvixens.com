  "TITLE": "Episode 59 - The Anti-Human Charade Continues",
  "NUMBER": 59,
  "DESCRIPTION": "Maddie is back after a rollercoaster end of summer, and shares fresh grief over her aunt’s passing. She and Jessie relate this to the actual lack of care of others, especially the most vulnerable right now, the ill, elderly, and the young and impressionable. Despite the cry of the virtue-signalers, it is apparent that they truly only care about themselves, and not those that are most at risk of the serious consequences of the lockdowns, psychotic protocols, and distancing. It’s anti-human to the core.",
