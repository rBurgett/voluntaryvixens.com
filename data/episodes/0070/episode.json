  "NUMBER": 70,
  "DESCRIPTION": "In this day and age, the definition for words are ever-changing. Maddie and I discuss how words like “fascism“ have gone through a myriad of definitions in just a short period of time. These changing definitions also have an impact on culture and how different groups look at each other and treat each other. When society is split in half, and they have different definitions of the same words, that rarely leads us in a positive direction.",
