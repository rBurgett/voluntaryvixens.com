  "TITLE": "Episode 15 - Yoga is for Libertarians",
  "NUMBER": 15,
  "DESCRIPTION": "Maddie takes the lead on this solo-sode to reflect on her time and experience in the yoga community, and discusses how much of a disparity there is between the yogic values and actual political stances of \"peace&love\" members of the yoga community. This is just an introductory episode to the idea that she'd love to explore and discuss further down the line (after more preparation and self-study!) but touches on how she believes the practice of yoga is truly in line with libertarian and voluntaryist values and principles. If you can forgive her for the rambling, and some woo woo-ness, you might see something that you haven't seen or thought of before. We all talk about how to spread the ideas of liberty, and understanding groups that may be more sympathetic to our views than we realize could be a step in the right direction.",
