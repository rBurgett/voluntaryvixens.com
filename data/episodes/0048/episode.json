  "NUMBER": 48,
  "DESCRIPTION": "We found more unicorns! Well, really they found us. Maddie and Jessie brought on the ladies behind the scenes of Voluntaryism In Action. We learned a lot about their organization and how they’re acting out the philosophy. From statists to voluntaryists, we’ve all come a long way. We talk about their current and upcoming charity projects, given the recent mayhem of the world, and gush about how much we love liberty. And Mises. So you, know, more silly girl stuff.",
