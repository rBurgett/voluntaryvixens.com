  "TITLE": "Episode 11 - Conversation with a Public School Teacher",
  "NUMBER": 11,
  "DESCRIPTION": "Jessie is going solo because Maddie decided Ireland and scotland is more exciting than podcasting. Jessie sits down with a local public school teacher to discuss what issues she faces under the weight of the all powerful department of education. We discuss standardized testing, state standards, how terrible meetings are, how terrible parents are, vouchers and teachers unions.  We also touch on behavioral issues with students and prevalence of child abuse by teachers. There was so much to talk about that there may need to be a part 2 to this discussion somewhere in the future.",
