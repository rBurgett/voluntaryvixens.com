  "NUMBER": 80,
  "DESCRIPTION": "From behind the walls of academia (well, academia on lockdown and work-from-home orders, that is), we are joined by Canadian research librarian (and fellow Misesian!),  Joanna Szurmak, to discuss the culture of fear and constant pessimism, and where that comes from. We also talk, more importantly, about how to overcome the doom and gloom and shining our lights in the pervasive darkness to which others can be drawn.",
