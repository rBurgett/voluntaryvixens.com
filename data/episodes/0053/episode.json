  "NUMBER": 53,
  "DESCRIPTION": "Maddie and Jessie were rejoined by THE Monica Perez, of the must-listen Propaganda Report podcast along with her co-host and producer, Brad Binkley. We talk about the (non-viral) illnesses that our society is facing: the infantilization of targeted groups, us being de-platformed, dependence to the state, allegiance to the false idols of the intelligentsia, and the toxicity of Marxism, considering how much that underlies much of today's political discourse and manufactured divisions. We didn't think we'd go this long, but we sure did.",
