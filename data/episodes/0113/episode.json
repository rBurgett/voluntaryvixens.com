  "TITLE": "Episode 113 - Gun Laws Are For Bitches",
  "NUMBER": 113,
  "DESCRIPTION": "David from the “Morning Drive with David” podcast joins Jessie to discuss the most recent shooting in Uvalde, Texas and reflect on his own experience being in a school shooting back in 1995. How would stricter gun laws stop these shootings from happening in the first place? Why is it that the people that know the least about guns ( including gun laws) are the ones that have the most say about what we should do with them?",
