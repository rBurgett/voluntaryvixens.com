  "TITLE": "Episode 66 - Collapsing the Narrative With Rita Rogers",
  "NUMBER": 66,
  "DESCRIPTION": "This week, Maddie and I sit down with Rita, a registered nurse working in the ICU. We talk through her experience working with COVID patients, how current COVID policies interfere with patient care, and how the corporate press and the Cathedral make her and every other nurse whose goal is to provide exemplary care to patients’ job far more difficult as the dark cloud of this coronavirus and the tyrannical government response lingers overhead. We all discuss how the COVID narrative is just another symptom of a very sick healthcare system where the emphasis is placed on treating disease rather than focusing on prevention and health. Rita is a wealth of information and a wonderful complement to Maddie and I as we tear down the narrative that has held the world captive since March.",
