  "TITLE": "Episode 35 - FAG Reunion",
  "NUMBER": 35,
  "DESCRIPTION": "Car and Bird fly on over for a good, old fashioned FAG Reunion. We talked about everyone’s fave, Cenk from TTY, his odd defense of beastiality (really, don’t Google that word), Katie Hill, how to not be a Creepertarian, why you shouldn’t be a cleavage-for-liberty chick, and got the full scoop on the up and coming CHILLDERBURG. It gets weird. But we love these guys. It’s nice to get some laughs in as FAGs.",
