## Notes

The Vixens this week were joined by Dr. Reid Sheftall, physicist turned plastic-then-cardiac surgeon and overall brilliant mind and contributor to what has been the contra-establishment science and narrative since February 2020. Early to catch on and see the patterns that didn’t make any sense, he’s been fighting to keep his message heard and the truth within reach. Joining them also, is recent but well-loved friend of the show, Dr. Mav. We had a great conversation and are always happy to grow this group of allies in medical freedom, bodily autonomy, and truth seekers.

You can find Dr. Sheftall’s latest book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Heroes-Villains-COVID-19-Book-Lists/dp/B0BKHQ7CWN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)
