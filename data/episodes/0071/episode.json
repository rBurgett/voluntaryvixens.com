  "TITLE": "Episode 71 - The Thick Red Line",
  "NUMBER": 71,
  "DESCRIPTION": "Maddie and Jessie were lucky enough to be connected (via a former guest on the show) to Howard Lichtman, one of the founding members of the recently organized Thick Red Line Project. Howard discusses its inception, utility, and applicability, especially in a year when the police are more pawn-like to the politicians that are all of our same enemies than we’ve seen in quite some time. We all have a choice, but TRL is aiming to give “officers of the peace” the tools to make better choices, more moral choices. This episode should have some unifying themes for you to bring to your friends/family on the left, right, and in untethered anarchyville.",
