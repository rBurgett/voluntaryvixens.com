Uwe works with people who are at the point of “giving up” or about to lose everything they love to help them restore their lives. They talk about how important we should see ourselves and our families and how it begins with the individual. There’s a lot of overlap with the principles of the voluntaryist movement. Uwe is a successful life coach who has clients all over the world. He plans to begin cohosting a podcast called “lifegasms” with friend Sherry Fetzer.",
