  "TITLE": "Episode 49 - Lessons From Tuskegee",
  "NUMBER": 49,
  "DESCRIPTION": "In this episode Jessie sits down with Truth, host of The Truth Disciple to go over the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment.  This leads to a great discussion on how black americans view and trust healthcare workers and how that has led up to either blind allegiance or huge distrust in the system as a whole.  There seems to be very little in between.  There is also more to unpack on this topic as Covid-19 is back in the news and it brings up more questions about how much trust we should put into the gigantic health care organizations like the CDC,  WHO and of course our buddy Billy Gates.",
