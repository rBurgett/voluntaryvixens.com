  "TITLE": "Episode 16 - Smells Like White Privilege",
  "NUMBER": 16,
  "DESCRIPTION": "That’s right, you do smell white privilege. And it’s lavender scented. Maddie and Jessie talk about everyone’s favorite -ism, laying out how the left tends to find racism in every nook and cranny and how in response, many on the right decide that it actually doesn’t exist. Per usual, they’re both wrong, and we try and show that middle ground where a rational person might find themselves.",
